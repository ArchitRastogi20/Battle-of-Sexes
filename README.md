# Battle-of-Sexes


We aimed to develop a simple Simulator in Java in order to study a basic evolutionary model comparing two different traits, 
using FPCS playoff tables and analyze differences between our results to Dawkinsâ€™ case study.
The core of the idea behind it is to give the user enough parameters and tools to play with the simulation and see how the results will deviate from the expected ones.
